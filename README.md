# JAVA-Project
random name picker

This is my project at school.

My taks is to code a random name picker for a prize draw.
Requiremnts i have to consider:

The Java FX Framework should always be used  
The user interface of the program should be designed to be user-friendly (usability)  
Strictly adhere to encapsulation (no public attributes, only use getters and setters) :white_check_mark:  
Your project should have at least these components:   
View -> For displaying the user interface (the view does not need its own Java class in JavaFX) :white_check_mark:   
Controller -> Takes over the control of the program as a link between the user interface and :white_check_mark:   
DataAccessObject -> Serves as a link for preparing and providing the data, which is stored in a list containing objects of the model class(es). :white_check_mark: 
It also provides 2 methods:  
LoadData -> loads saved data as CSV :white_check_mark:  
SavaData -> saves data as CSV :white_check_mark:  
Model class(es) :white_check_mark:   
Saves one data set each and makes the individual values accessible via getters:white_check_mark:  
is managed by the DataAccessObject :white_check_mark:  
Each program calculates and creates something according to the task description :white_check_mark:   
The data/results should be able to be saved and loaded :white_check_mark:  
Create a UML class diagram of your program (drawn e.g. with draw.io, not automatically generated(!))  
The requirements and tasks are minimum requirements, beyond that you should extend the program in a meaningful way, this additional effort will also be taken into account in the evaluation.  
 

It is a fun project because i had trouble coding.
At the moment IÂ´m pretty confident because it is working ^^

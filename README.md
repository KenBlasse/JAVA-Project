# JAVA-Project
random name picker

This is my project at school.

My taks is to code a random name picker for a prize draw.
Requiremnts i have to consider:
- JavaFX
- model class with getter/setter
- save/load csv format
- time and date in save and shown on load
- DAO to handle model

It is a fun project because i had trouble coding.
At the moment IÂ´m pretty confident because it is working ^^

# JAVA-Project
random name picker

This is my project at school.

My taks is to code a random name picker for a prize draw.
Requiremnts i have to consider:

The Java FX Framework should always be used  
The user interface of the program should be designed to be user-friendly (usability)  
Strictly adhere to encapsulation (no public attributes, only use getters and setters)  
Your project should have at least these components:   
View -> For displaying the user interface (the view does not need its own Java class in JavaFX)  
Controller -> Takes over the control of the program as a link between the user interface and   
DataAccessObject -> Serves as a link for preparing and providing the data, which is stored in a list containing objects of the model class(es). It also provides 2 methods:  
LoadData -> loads saved data as CSV  
SavaData -> saves data as CSV  
Model class(es)   
Saves one data set each and makes the individual values accessible via getters  
is managed by the DataAccessObject  
Each program calculates and creates something according to the task description   
The data/results should be able to be saved and loaded  
Create a UML class diagram of your program (drawn e.g. with draw.io, not automatically generated(!))  
The requirements and tasks are minimum requirements, beyond that you should extend the program in a meaningful way, this additional effort will also be taken into account in the evaluation.  
 

It is a fun project because i had trouble coding.
At the moment IÂ´m pretty confident because it is working ^^

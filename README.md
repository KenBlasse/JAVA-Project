## JAVA project

---

This is my project at school. It's a random name picker.

I need to create a program that can randomly choose a name for a prize draw.

Here are the things I have to think about: (✅ = done )

- The Java FX Framework should always be used. ✅
- The user interface of the program should be easy to use.
- Strictly adhere to encapsulation (no public attributes, only use getters and setters) ✅
- Your project should have at least these components:
  - View: Displays the user interface (the view does not need its own Java class in JavaFX) ✅
  - Controller: Controls the program as a link between the user interface and ✅
  - DataAccessObject: Prepares and provides data, which is stored in a list containing objects of the model class(es). It also provides two methods. ✅
  - LoadData loads saved data as CSV ✅
  - SaveData saves data as CSV ✅
  - Model class(es) ✅
  - Saves one data set each and makes the individual values accessible via getters ✅
  - Is managed by the DataAccessObject ✅
- Each program calculates and creates something according to the task description ✅
- The data/results should be able to be saved and loaded ✅
- Create a UML class diagram of your program (drawn e.g. Withdraw.io, not automatically generated (!).
- The requirements and tasks are the bare minimum. If you do more, you will be evaluated for that extra effort. ✅

It's a fun project because I found the coding difficult. I'm quite sure it's working at the moment.

Last part is to expand it on my own. Dont know what to implement yet...
